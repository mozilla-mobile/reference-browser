experiments.metrics:
  active_experiment:
    type: string
    description: >
      Records the branch name of the active experiment, if the client is enrolled in any experiments.
      This is intended to validate that the service-experiments library properly matches clients to
      experiments and can take action based on a multi-branched experiment. This is done by recording
      the experiment branch name in this string metric which allows the experiment to be transparent
      and unobtrusive to the user.
