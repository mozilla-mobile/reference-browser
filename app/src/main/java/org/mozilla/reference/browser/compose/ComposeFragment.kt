/**
 * Base class for fragments that use Compose UI and have a 1:1 relationship with a Composable, i.e
 * Fragments that do not have [View]s and [ComposeView]s defined in the XML layout.
 *
 * The ViewCompositionStrategy is set to [ViewCompositionStrategy.DisposeOnLifecycleDestroyed],
 * meaning that the [ComposeView] will be disposed when the Fragment's view is destroyed.
