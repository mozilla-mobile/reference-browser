# /!\ This implementation differs from what android-components, fenix, and focus have.
# The main reason is: a-c is much more complex and subject to changes. The 3 projects
# being in the same repo, they all follow the same model. This means, there's a
# mechanism to ensure the content of `gradlew printVariants` stays in sync with the
# .buildconfig.yml files.
#
# Here, we're just tracking a handful build_types, so we don't need the same complexity
# as what was introduced in https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android/pull/340.
#
# If you want to update this variable, just run `gradlew printVariants` and copy-paste
# the result.
