#  Reference Browser

[![Task Status](https://firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com/api/github/v1/repository/mozilla-mobile/reference-browser/main/badge.svg)](https://firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com/tasks/index/mobile.v2.reference-browser.nightly.latest) [![chat.mozilla.org](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-on%20matrix-51bb9c)](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#android-components:mozilla.org)

A web browser reference implementation using [Mozilla Android Components](https://mozac.org).

*The Reference Browser is not a product intended to ship to end users. Instead it is a Technology Preview for many new mobile components that multiple teams at Mozilla are currently working on*

It includes the Mozilla Web Platform via GeckoView, a new modern Firefox Accounts and Cloud Sync implementation and the new "Glean" telemetry library. All these components will be foundational for Mozilla's existing and upcoming Android products.

The Reference Browser can also be a starting point for your own new browser-like applications. It depends heavily on the [Android Components](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/mobile/android/android-components) project where most of the actual implementation lives. That project also includes many smaller sample applications.

**Will Reference Browser move to mozilla-central?**

Reference Browser is meant to be a reference implementation of the Android Components project. Having it live outside of the mozilla source-tree lets us:

1. See how core browsing APIs work for browser-based projects outside of Firefox.
2. Have a developer playground to try experimental APIs in a safe way that involves a full build, signing, and publishing process.
3. Validates that our [maven](https://nightly.maven.mozilla.org) [repositories](https://maven.mozilla.org) and Google Play publishing infrastructure is still functioning - if we no longer receive maven artifacts or Google Play builds are not working, we would know that there is something systematically wrong with these processes.

# Local Development

You might be interested in building this project against local versions of some of the dependencies. Depending on which dependencies you're building against, there are couple of paths.

## Auto-publication workflow

This is the most streamlined workflow which fully automates dependency publication. It currently supports [android-components](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/) and [application-services](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services) dependencies.

In a `local.properties` file in root of the `reference-browser` checkout, specify relative paths to a repository you need (or both):
```
# Local workflow
autoPublish.android-components.dir=../android-components
autoPublish.application-services.dir=../application-services
```

That's it! Next build of `reference-browser` will be against your local versions of these repositories. Simply make changes in `android-components` or `application-services`, press Play in `reference-browser` and those changes will be picked-up.

See a [demo of this workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZKlBzVvQGc) in action. Video mentions `Fenix`, but it works in exactly the same with with `reference-browser`.

## Dependency substitutions for [GeckoView](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central)

GeckoView currently can be configured via a dependency substitution.

In a `local.properties` file in root of the `reference-browser` checkout, specify GeckoView's path via `dependencySubstitutions.geckoviewTopsrcdir=/path/to/mozilla-central` (and, optionally, `dependencySubstitutions.geckoviewTopobjdir=/path/to/topobjdir`). See [Bug 1533465](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1533465).

This assumes that you have built, packaged, and published your local GeckoView -- but don't worry, the dependency substitution script has the latest instructions for doing that.

Do not forget to run a Gradle sync in Android Studio after changing `local.properties`. If you specified any substitutions (e.g. GeckoView), they will be reflected in the modules list, and you'll be able to modify them from a single Android Studio window. For auto-publication workflow, use seperate Android Studio windows.
